  <h1>W3C Automotive Web Payments Task Force</h1>

  <p><b>STATUS:</b> This is a draft description of a joint task force of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/">Automotive and Web Platform Business Group</a> and the <a href="/WebCommerce/IG/">Web Commerce Interest Group</a>.</p>

  <p>The mission of the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/automotive-pay/wiki">Automotive Web Payments Task Force</a> is to
    support streamlined and secure Web payments from connected
    vehicles.</p>

  <h2>Leadership</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Rodrigo Meirelles, WEX</li>
    <li>Ted Guild, W3C</li>
    <li>Ian Jacobs, W3C</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scope</h2>

  <h3>Activities</h3>


  <ul>
    <li><strong>Build shared understanding</strong>: To start, the task force will build a shared understanding of the connected vehicle ecosystem.</li>
    <li><strong>Describe use cases</strong>: The task force will describe use cases for automotive Web payments.</li>
    <li><strong>Do a gap analysis</strong>: The task force will study
 existing and emerging Web standards that might bear on the use cases, then
identify and prioritize gaps in Web technology to address the use cases.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Out of scope</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Incubation of technical work</strong>: The Web Payments Interest Group is not chartered to develop specifications. Therefore, any specification work should happen within a different type of W3C group.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Topics</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Pay at the pump / charging station</li>
    <li>Tolls &amp; Road usage</li>
    <li>Parking</li>
    <li>Retail Point of Sale (POS) (such as "drive-thru")</li>
    <li>Driver Distractability</li>
    <li>Automated payments (e.g., delegation of authority to the vehicle to make payments)</li>
    <li>Shared Vehicles</li>
    <li>Connectivity</li>
    <li>Some but not all vehicles will include browser runtimes, so the task force may explore both in-browser and out-of-browser approaches (such as described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/2016/SUBM-viwi-protocol-20161213/">ViWi protocol</a>)</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h2>Deliverables</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Prioritized automotive payments use cases</li>
    <li>Web technology gap analysis to satisfy the use cases</li>
    <li>Plan for incubation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Timeline</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>By end of August: Prioritization of topics and initial use case descriptions</li>
    <li>By end of September: Detailed prioritized use case descriptions</li>
    <li>By end of October: Initial gap analysis</li>
    <li>TPAC 2017 face-to-face discussion of results</li>
    <li>By early December: Plan for incubation</li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Participation</h2>

  <p>Participants from
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/">Automotive
  and Web Platform Business Group</a> and
  the <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a> are
    invited to join this task force.</p>

  <p>Participation from different parts of the ecosystem will be important to ensuring the quality and relevance of the deliverables. This includes participation from:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Auto manufacturers</li>
    <li>Tier One providers</li>
    <li>Fuel and service companies</li>
    <li>Merchants and merchant associations</li>
    <li>Digital wallet / payment app developers</li>
    <li>Fleet management companies</li>
    <li>Web technology specialists</li>
    <li>Payment solution providers (e.g., POS vendors, shopping cart providers)</li>
    <li>Standards bodies involved in vehicle payments (e.g., IFSF, Conexxus)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Meetings</h2>

  <p>Initially, the task force should plan to meet every two weeks by phone.</p>

  <p>The BG and IG plan to meet during TPAC 2017 but on different days. The task force should therefore endeavor to schedule a face-to-face discussion on the Wednesday of TPAC.</p>

  <h2>Communication</h2>

  <p>This group conducts its technical work on the public mailing list
  at public-automotive-pay@w3.org (<a
  href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-automotive-pay/">archive</a>). See
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/">W3C mailing list and archive usage
  guidelines</a>. There is also a private list restricted to task
  force participants and W3C Members to be used for administrative purposes at internal-automotive-pay@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/internal-automotive-pay/">archive</a>).</p>

Information about the group (documents under review, face-to-face meetings, etc.) is available from the Web Payments Interest Group home page. 

  <h2>Decision Policy</h2>

  <p>Task force decisions do not in themselves constitute decisions of the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/">Automotive
    and Web Platform Business Group</a> or <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web
    Payments Interest Group</a>. Each group follows its own process
    for recording decisions (e.g., statements of support) for the task
    force deliverables.</p>

  <p>The task force will pursue consensus decisions.</p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property Considerations</h2>

  <p>Each participant is subject to the intellectual property commitments made upon joining either the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/autowebplatform/">Automotive
    and Web Platform Business Group</a> or the <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web
      Payments Interest Group</a>.</p>
